# C++ Learning Journey 🚀  

This repo is my personal space for learning **C++ from absolute basics to advanced concepts**.  
Right now it’s pretty empty — but that’s intentional. I’m starting from zero and building it step by step, keeping track of everything I learn, practice, and create along the way.  

## 📚 What you’ll find here (eventually)  
- Beginner programs (hello world, loops, arrays, etc.)  
- Notes, quizzes, and small coding exercises  
- Intermediate topics like OOP, templates, and file handling  
- Advanced concepts such as STL, memory management, and multithreading  
- Mini-projects to put knowledge into practice  
- My experiments, mistakes, and fixes (because learning is never perfect 😅)  

## 🎯 Why this repo exists  
I wanted a single place to organize my progress, practice problems, and projects while learning C++.  
Instead of just doing things offline, I’ll be using GitHub to track my growth and share what I’ve learned.  

## 🔄 Current Status  
📌 Empty for now — starting fresh. The plan is to commit small bits regularly as I learn and practice.  

## 🏆 Goals  
- Build a solid foundation in C++  
- Document progress with clear, understandable code  
- Tackle increasingly complex problems  
- Eventually have a full record of my journey from beginner → advanced
